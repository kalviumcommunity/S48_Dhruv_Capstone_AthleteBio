Project Proposal: AthleteBio

Topic: AthleteBio - Creating and Managing Formula 1 Driver Biographies

Objective: The objective of the AthleteBio project is to create a comprehensive platform where detailed biographies of Formula 1 drivers, including their career highlights, achievements, and stats for all years they have participated, are available. The platform is designed to be like an "athlete Wikipedia," where users can search for drivers and view their detailed information. Additionally, the platform will include a quiz feature to engage users with fun and informative questions about Formula 1. This can be extended to other sports as well in the future.
